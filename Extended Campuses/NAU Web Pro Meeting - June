Web Application Security
	- Presentation by Brian
	- Nau.edu/its/security
	- "Security Essentials" is mandatory training for everyone
		○ Mandatory since last Fall
			§ I believe for all NAU ITS staff
		○ Not an annual training
	- All phishing emails should be reported: "Report a Suspicious Email"
		○ Send all reports through website above
		○ Basically copy/paste header and body into web app
		○ //From what it sounds like, it looks like phishing is a problem for NAU Employees, this has been a concern for NAU Security
		○ Avoid using hyperlinks in emails (either placing them or using them)
	- Provides some scanning services
	- Resources on ssl/tls/ciphers
	- Qualyst Enterprise - 
		○ Scanning appliances
		○ Provides services to scan IP/hosts
		○ Access to this services is limited, usually have to go through NAU ITS Security to set this up
			§ Limited to number of web projects that can be "saved" to the services; due to licensing 
		○ This services usually finds open ports
		○ Using scans for web applications is a bit more tricky, than servers
			§ Can find X-side scripting
			§ SQL injection vulnerability
			
• Trey Presenter: Selenium IDE (Automation)
	- Front end testing tool, through the browser
	- Mimic human input
		○ Dragging/dropping
	- Two version:
		○ Web Driver (accessed via programming)
			§ .net
		○ Selenium IDE (Firefox plugin GUI, only)
	- Reasons:
		○ Automate repetitive tasks
		○ Run test across many pages/sites
		○ Check hundreds of fields, validations
		○ Can be used by non-developers
		○ Well documented
		○ Can record human action
	- How it works:
		○ Simple script format
		○ Uses an HTML table to define the actions
			§ This HTML is editable
		○ Provides more menu options when you right click in Firefox to apply specific methods (i.e.; verifyText)
	- Demo
	- Questions
		○ I could be used to check for vulnerabilities as well. You could script it to insert a script attack and run the test.
	- //Can be used to verify invalidation
	- //Promotes Unit Testing
	- //Good tool for BA's
	- Tips:
		○ Use clean , unique IDs and Class anames on HTML elements
		○ Use CSS selectors vs Xpath whenever possible
		○ Start with Firefox version before programmatic ones

	- Building 90's big meeting room is taken over
	- Next meeting might be in EC
