	Have travelled sometime now.

	Timer: 18 hours
	Detonated the pass as an illusion to fool Callard Seabain

	While sleeping I woke to notice a "humanoid" figure what appears to be riding a limp beast corpse but travelling fast  

	Timer: 16 hours

	Attempted to go down the hill and Zib failed spectacularly
	The beast bucks off Zib and starts to run away.
	I run after the beast. ALong the way I clumsily grab the rope that was once on the beast.
	I leap into the air to lasso the beast around the neck. After a divine interferance I was able to rope the beast and bring it to a stop.
	I bring it back to Zib and I attempt to ride the beast first.
	I have full command of the beast (for the day).
	(name of beast is Abatrol)
	
	Timer: 15 horus

	We are riding throught the desert.

	Timer: 12 hours

	Zib and I switch.
	Steady jog.

	Timer: 4 hours 

	See an object on the side of the path.
	We investigate. We see that is the Zaar. But no Raminel.
	Large single gashes in the "hide" of the Zaar.
	Looking around the area, as Zib investigates the body of the Zaar, I found signs of battle and tracks. I have determined that this has to be the act of the Dread Destroyers' Side Guards (both of them). I also know that it appears to be two different types of slashing attacks (One would be their weapon, the other would be their tail). 

	In our investigation of the Zaar's body we found two objects:
	1. Growth Device: One character touched by this device perjanently gows a foot taller. this poroces is painful and takes 28 hours, during which time the affected character is impaired.
	2. the device is used to take a sample of the user's skin. The user sets the control panel to choose an organ he would like to regrow (such as an ear, finger, or eyeball). The device produces a 4-inch by 2-inch stip of a sticky, fleshlike substance that the user places on his body. In 28 hours, he has a newlyt grown organ. Once the organ is fully grown and properly placed, it self-sticks and begins to grow connections to the user's body. if allowed to attach for 28 hours without taking damage, the new organ becomes permanent.

	We continue to follow the Dread Destroyer

	We approach a hill view to see the Dread Destroyer near the Mouth Carnes and is blocked by a power of light force. This light seems to calm the Dread Destoryer for a time but continues the rampage every now and then.

	I discover that the pluses of light seems to be a form of communication. I recall back to my training and it is similar to glinting light off of shields to communcate long distances. If given time I could somewhat make sense of a message.

	As we continue towards the Dread Destoryer I am able to pull letters from the message..."____ __F___"

	"____ __F_N_"

	"H___ __F_N_"

	"H_L_ __F_N_"

	We see that the light will temporaily fade out and come back; basically we know that it is weakening.
	The Dread Destoryer is now flying in the air; well more like hovering. And is casing down a red circular light. We noticed that people that attempt to leave the red light get incinerated.

	Draw closer. "H_L_ D_F_N_"

	"H_L_ DEF_N_"

	"H_L_ DEFEN_"

	"HEL_ DEFEND"

	The light is extinguished

	I notice that the figure is the same person I saw zooming accross ground when we were resting.
	Appears to be wearing Eon Priest(ess) robes.

	Zib discovered that the "white light" was actually compacted data. 

	We approach the red light.

	I perform some test with throwing a rock; no reaction.
	I hold out my gauntlet to the red light; nothing happens.
	I pull out a roasted fowl from my pack. Eat a leg. I throw the other leg through the red light; nothing happens.

	Zib contemplates to push Me through the light...he acts. But I step in one direction. He did not expect this and ended up falling through the light, face planting into the discarded cooked fowl leg.
	I, pulling the mount, walk through the light. I feel very warm.

	Zib throws the leg back through...we see it vaporaized. There is a beam of light that causes a crater to be formed. We all (mount including) safely avoid any damage from the light.

	We clean our selves up and meet up with the cloak figure.

	She names herself as Moran. She reveals herself as someone that wishes to protect the people 
	She reveals that she has communicated with the dread destoryer. The dread destoryer is looking for something and could not find it so it is a bit angry. She succesfully negociated to stall for 28 hours. 

	She prsents a ball that opens to reveal a message (in light). It shows the fortress of Callard Seabain (movie stock video); near Mor Lash Core. Callard Seabain speaks and says that he needs our help to "Save the World"

	We discover that Moran worked under Callad Seabain for a while. She has deep admiration for him; and knows his dark secret. She tells us that he wants to negociate with the Dread Destoryer. Try to learn as much as possible from it. (Her dreams is to become an Eon Priest; but dedcicated).

	Zib asked Moran about the Dread Destroyer's "Royal Guards". What she knows is that this is an uncommon event. Majority of Dread Destoyers are solitary. So at some point when the Dread Destroyer rose it became accompanied by the "Royal Guards". They have discovered that there was a single path of follow the leadering happening. The Dread Destroyer is connection to one guard and the other guard is connected to the other guard.

	We have deteremined that the Dread Destoryer will bring down the hammer in 25 hours. Also tht Calard Seabane should arrive in 16 hours.

	Zib looks for healing stuff.

	I look for healing items. I found a strange object and use it. Unbeknownst to me I know feel very invigorated (Gen 1 Might point per min for the next 1 hour). I feel almost as if I was on a caffiene and sugar high.

	In this time Zib finds and grabs some berries that have some glowing pieces. 

	Moran and Zib find an artifact that scans food to detect poisons or "contaminants". Zib actually knows this device; he had one when he was younger. He knows what it does. In his experience, it blinks a green light if the food is good; and red if the food is bad. They scan the berries and the artifact blinks a purple light. I decide to use my cipher (the Necter Extruder) and pour out three bowls of the necter. They scan the necter and it blinks back purple. Moran decided to eat one. Nothing happens. We put the berries and necter into a jar (food for later).

	We head to the door. I check the door for traps. Im my inspection I noticed it is well made. I dont know how it would have gotten passed this door if it were not open already.

	As we head into the tunnel we notice the remnance of a broken web and a spider carcus. I put the carcus into my bag, bloody and all.

	I am charging ahead. I realize the path i a spiral going inward. I see a Stone type monster with a single eye. I, in my rashness, throw my shield at it. It hits it but has no effect on the monster. I recall my shield back. It then fires a psychic shot at me I barely survive the blast. I run back to the group. Explain the situation and then rest.
